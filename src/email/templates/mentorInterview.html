<p>We're excited for your practice interview with {{request.givenName}}.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: After your interview, please <a href="{{feedbackUrl}}">submit your feedback here.</a></p>
<p>It's up to you how you would like to conduct the session, but here are our suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Non-technical interviewers: we recommend you focus on the behavioral portion of interviews
    (<a href="https://devskiller.com/45-behavioral-questions-to-use-during-non-technical-interview-with-developers/">sample questions</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Technical interviewers: we recommend you start with a straightforward whiteboarding problem (such as bubble sort,
    DFS/BFS, binary search, etc) and adjust what you ask based on performance.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>(FYI: you can change your limits or stop volunteering at any time by replying to this email.)</p>
